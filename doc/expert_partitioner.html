<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
This document is the specification for a new YaST2 partitioner module.
</p>


<h2>Intentions</h2>

<p>
This new partitioner is intended for <b>experts</b> who know what they are
doing. Novice users should stick with the automatic mode that will
still be available.
</p>

<p>
Being fool-proof is not one of the primary goals for this expert
partitioner. But providing the required functionality is. So excessive
input and logic validations will be sacrificed for the sake of
completeness. If the user decides it is OK the way he specified the
partitioner will not question that.
</p>

<p>
At least the first version of this partitioner will be limited to the
i386 PC platform. It will not support BSD disk labels or any other
platform specific partitioning schemes.
</p>


<h1>Functional Specification</h1>

<p>
This section describes the functionality required for any partitioner
regardless of its respective user interface.
</p>


<h2>Required Functionality</h2>

<h3>Create A Partition</h3>

<p>(i386 specific)</p>

<p>
Any of the following partition types can be created:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Primary</li>
<li>Extended</li>
<li>Logical</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is subject so the following restrictions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
No more than four primary partitions per disk may be created.
</li>

<li>
No more than one extended partition per disk may be created.
</li>

<li>
An extended partition may only be created if no more than three
primary partitions exist on that disk yet (since the extended
partition is nothing else than a special primary partition).
</li>

<li>
Logical partitions may only be created if an extended partition
already exists on that disk.
</li>

<li>
A new logical partition can only be appended at the end of the list of
logical partitions. This is a restriction the underlying 'fdisk'
program imposes. If there is free space within the extended partition
between logical partitions, the partitions following the free space
will have to be deleted before the free space can be used.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
For primary partitions and the extended partition, the partition name
(e.g. /dev/hda1 - /dev/hda2) needs to be specified.
</p>

<p>
In order to stay compatible with other operating systems on the same
machine, those partition names cannot be selected automatically:
PC technology does not require the table entries to be sorted
according to starting cylinder etc. - they might as well be mixed at
random, and other OSes might rely on one of the slots to contain the
address (i.e. the start and end cylinders) of one of their
partitions. 
</p>

<p>
For logical partitions, the partition name will be automatically
generated: There is no central table for logical partitions within the
extended partition. Rather, one logical partition points to the next
one (or, more precisely, wraps the next one). So always the next free
slot will be used.
</p>

<p>
For all types of partitions, the following values need to be specified:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Start cylinder.
</li>

<li>
End cylinder.
</li>

<li>
File system type - one of
	<ul>
	<li>Linux ext2</li>
	<li>Linux swap</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li>
Mount point.
</li>

<li>
Whether or not this partition should be formatted. This is necessary
because the user might be forced to delete and then re-create
partitions in order to perform certain modifications (e.g. delete a
logical partition other than the last) where only partiton table
information will be modified, not the data within the partition. This
is some kind of last resort when all else fails.
</li>

<li>
Optional: The inode density.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Start and end cylinder values are subject to the following
restrictions:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
1 <= start cylinder <= end cylinder <= last cylinder on this disk
</li>

<li>
Primary partitions (including an extended partition!) may not overlap.
</li>

<li>
Logical partitions are limited by the extended partition's boundaries.
</li>

<li>
Logical partitions may not overlap.
</li>

</ul>


<h3>Delete A Partition</h3>

<p>(i386 specific)</p>

<p>
The user can delete a partition subject to the following restrictions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
An extended partition can only be deleted if there are no more logical
partitions within it.
</li>

<li>
Only the last of the logical partitions can be deleted.
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Optional Functionality</h2>

<h3>Modify A Partition</h3>

<p>
Since the underlying 'fdisk' program does not provide a facility to
actually modify a partition's cylinder boundaries other than deleting
and re-creating a partition, this "modify" facility cannot offer
modification of all of the "create" facility's fields, namely the
start and end cylinders.
</p>

<p>
The following values can be changed:
<p>

<ul>
<li>File system type (ext2/swap)</li>
<li>Mount point</li>
<li>Format flag (i.e. whether or not this partition should be formatted)</li>
<li>Optional: Inode density</li>
</ul>


<h3>Re-Read Partition Table</h3>

<p>
This function abandons all modifications to the original partitioning
on the hard disk(s) and re-reads the original partition tables.
</p>



<h3>Default Partitioning</h3>

<p>
This will do the same as the novice mode automatic partitioning. The
resulting partitioning scheme can be used as a basis for further
customization.
</p>



<h2>Data Flow</h2>

<h3>Input Data</h3>

<ul>
<li>A list of available hard disks including</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Hard disk device name (e.g. "/dev/hda")</li>

<h1>User Interface Specification</h1>


<h2>Lessons Learned - The YaST1 Partitioner In Comparison</h2>

<p>
The YaST1 partitioner provided all of the required and most of the
optional functionality described above.
</p>

<p>
YaST1 used to have a sequence of screens like this:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Select one of the available hard disks or skip partitioning alltogether.
</li>

<li>Create / delete partitions on that selected disk, set file system
type for individual partitions.
</li>

<li>
Set mount points and inode density for partitions on the selected
disk and/or read the /etc/fstab of an existing installation (for the
mount points specified there).
</li>

<li>
Go back to 1., i.e. if the user is finished with all of his hard disks
he has to choose "skip partitioning" there in order to get out of this
cycle.
</li>

</ol>

<p>
A lot of confusion can be avoided if the new partitioner does not
require the user to go through a sequence of screens like this,
manually choosing when to terminate that process and continue with the
installation. <b>Avoiding this is a design goal.</b>
</p>

<p>
Providing a <b>better overview</b> of the system's hard disks and their
respective partitions (and any free space left) is another. It is much
easier to have all information on one screen when trying to decide
which disk should hold what part of the Linux system to be installed
than switching back and forth between several screens.
</p>

<p>
Users should not be required to make notes on paper during that
process just to keep track of partitions on several disks and their
respective sizes.
</p>

<p>
Plus, many low-end PC systems only have one single hard disk to begin
with. So step (1) above most of the times is unnecessary but still
required here since this is the only exit from that screen sequence
loop.
</p>

<p>
And this category of users will not be overloaded with information in
one single dialog because this dialog of course will contain
information about their one single hard disk.
</p>


<h2>The YaST2 Expert Partitioner User Interface</h2>

<p>
All hard disks and all partitions on them will be displayed on the
screen in a scrolled window.
</p>

<p>
Each hard disk will be displayed in one line including:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Name (e.g. /dev/hda)</li>
<li>Start cylinder (always 1)</li>
<li>End cylinder (i.e. number of cylinders)</li>
<li>Capacity (human readable, i.e. in mega- or gigabytes)</li>
<li>Vendor string (i.e. hard disk name, e.g. "SEAGATE ST48012").
</ul>


<p>
Each partition will be displayed in one line including:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Name (e.g. /dev/hda2)</li>
<li>Start cylinder</li>
<li>End cylinder</li>
<li>Size (human readable, i.e. in mega- or gigabytes)</li>
<li>The format flag. If the partition is to be formatted, the letter
"F" will be displayed here. If not, this field will remain empty.</li>
<li>Partition type (human readable, i.e. in text format -
e.g. "FAT16", "Linux ext2", "Linux swap")</li>
<li>Mount point, if applicable</li>
<li>Format flag</li>
</ul>

<p>
Free space between partitions or at the end of a disk will be
displayed along with the partitions. This will include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Start cylinder</li>
<li>End cylinder</li>
<li>Size (human readable, i.e. in mega- or gigabytes)</li>
<li>Indication of free space (e.g. fixed text "[free]")</li>
</ul>

<p>
Partition and segments of free space will be displayed sorted by (a)
hard disk and (b) start cylinder.
</p>

<h4>Subject to discussion:</h4>

<p>
Hard disks, primary, extended and logical partitions and free space
should be indented to reflect hierarchy they have. Thus it would be
much easier to explain to the not-yet-so-expert user the connections
between extended and logical partitions and why he cannot simply
delete an extended partition as long as there are still logical
partitions within it.
</p>

<p>
The tradeoff, however, is screen space. This indentation might eat up
just the screen space necessary to avoid horizontal scrolling (which
makes operating this screen very annoying). But if possible with a
reasonable amount of work, this indentation should be done.
</p>


<h2>Selection</h2>

<p>
Before any action (create, delete, ...) can be performed, a list entry
(i.e. a hard disk, a partition or a segment of free space) has to be
selected. Depending on that selection, the user can perform actions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Hard disk selected:</li>
	<ul><li>Create (primary or extended)</li></ul>

<li>Primary partition selected:</li>
	<ul><li>Delete</li></ul>
	<ul><li>Modify</li></ul>

<li>Extended partition selected:</li>
	<ul><li>Create (logical)</li></ul>
	<ul><li>Delete</li></ul>

<li>Logical partition selected:</li>
	<ul><li>Delete</li></ul>
	<ul><li>Modify</li></ul>

<li>Free space selected:</li>

	<ul><li>Create (free space boundaries as
	start/end cylinder defaults)</li></ul>
</ul>

<p>
Modifying hard disks, extended partitions or free space does not make
any sense. Neither does deleting hard disks (automatic eject?) or free
space.
</p>

<p>
"Default Partitioning" and "Re-Read Partition Table" are independent
of any selection. They may be performed at any time.
</p>


<h2>Operations</h2>

<p>
For each of the required and optional functions, a push button will be
provided:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Create</li>
<li>Delete</li>
<li>Modify</li>
<li>Default Partitioning</li>
<li>Re-Read from Disk</li>
</ul>

<h3>Create</h3>

<p>
The "create" button will open a popup dialog window to select a
partition type (primary, extended or logical). This popup window
includes an "OK" button and a "Cancel" button.
</p>

<p>
Upon making a selection and pressing the "OK" button, another dialog
window will be popped up with the following fields:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Partition name. For primary and extended partitions only. Select
one of the four primary partition slots. For logical partitions, this
will be an output-only field containing the next available partition
slot name.
</li>

<li>
Start cylinder - absolute cylinder address.
</li>

<li>
End cylinder - either as an absolute cylinder address (e.g. "120")
or relative to the starting cylinder (e.g. "+70") or in megabytes
(e.g. "+300M"). A megabyte value will be rounded to the next cylinder
boundary.
</li>

<li>
The file system type (list box or radio box) - one of
	<ul>
	<li>Linux ext2</li>
	<li>Linux swap</li>
	</ul>
Linux ext2 is the default.
</li>

<li>
A mount point. No automagic here, just a plain text entry field.
</li>

<li>
The format flag (a check box).
</li>

<li>
Inode density (plain entry field). This may be left blank. In this
case, a reasonable default value will be used.
</li>

</ul>


<h3>Delete</h3>

<p>
The user will be prompted for confirmation when activating this
function.
</p>


<h3>Modify</h3>

<p>
This opens the same dialog like the "create" function's second popup
dialog with the fields for partition name, start cylinder, and end
cylinder disabled. Those values will be displayed, however.
</p>


<h3>Re-Read Partition Table</h3>

<p>
The user will be prompted for confirmation when activating this
function.
</p>


<h3>Default Partitioning</h3>


<p>
If the partitioning has been modified in any way, the user will be
prompted for confirmation when activating this function since this
will essentially abandon all changes.
</p>
